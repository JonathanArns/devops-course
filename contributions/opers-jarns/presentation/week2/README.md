Presentation

## Description

We would like to give a presentation about the testing framework Jepsen, a framework made for the testing of Distributed Systems. It is a framework that tests distributed systems, specifically, for resilience against partial failures. The presentation will delve into why such a tool is necessary, how it works, how it compares to more conventional testing frameworks (why they can not/should not be used for the same task), and a brief overview of how to use it.

The presentation will have a focus on why this type of tool is necessary and why it should not or can not be done with other tools.

### Relevance

Jepsen's nature as an automated testing framework makes it a relevant tool for DevOps, sitting right at the intersection of DevOps and distributed systems. As distributed systems are commonplace in today's society, the relevance for testing tools, within a Continuous Integration pipeline, for such a system needs to be commonplace as well.
