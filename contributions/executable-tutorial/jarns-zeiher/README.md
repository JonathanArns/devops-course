Simple End to End GitOps with Werf

## Names and KTH ID
  - Jonathan Arns (jarns@kth.se)
  - Fabian Zeiher (zeiher@kth.se)

## Deadline

## Description
Our tutorial will show how to setup and use a simple GitOps pipeline using Werf.
We will use a small Rust web-app from a personal side-project as the application in this tutorial.

**Relevance**
GitOps is obviously relevant to the course.
Using a small, but real application will make for a nice tutorial that will enable students to
start using GitOps (and Werf) in their own projects.
